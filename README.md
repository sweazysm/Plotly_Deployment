# Plotly Deployment


When working with Javascript files in analysing Belly Button Washing data (really?) many issues were found with CORS responses and issues with referencing the samples.json files and init(); functions. These errors were alleviated when files were opened up on separate computing devices. While this assignment allowed myself and others to work with json and html more closely, it led to many unsolved issues with displaying data that were not easily solved. The displayed data can be shown below.

When the data was to be displayed, it showed propert demograpghic information, a bar chart, a bubble chart, and the gauge. All formatted items appeared properly, but not on my own computer.







A note to the reviewer: None of these files open up properly on my computer but it opens up properly on other computers. I am using a MacBook Air, it seems to open up properly on Windows devices.
